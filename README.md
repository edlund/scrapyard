# Scrapyard - Bits and pieces of this and that

This is where tests, examples and tutorials come to die, or if they are
lucky, to spend some time in limbo before they are recycled and put to
good use.

Feel free to look around and use anything that seems remotely useful,
everything is made available under the Boost License 1.0, but do not
expect much.
